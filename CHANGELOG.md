### Fixed
- TBA queue detection

## [0.5.0] - 2024-12-24
### Removed
- All CLI configuration arguments - Use the configuration file or environmental vars in future

### Added
- `--generate-config` CLI command - Generates a configuration file using either the current env vars, or defaults

## [0.4.0] - 2024-12-11
### Removed
- `SCRUBARR_SONARR_PORT` & `SCRUBARR_OMIT_PORT` options and CLI arguments

  be automatically added into a newly generated configuration file on first start up for this minor version

### Added

env var. For Docker builds, this will be `/config/settings.json`
